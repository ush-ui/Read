Happy 1-year anniversary, cutu! ❤️

Has it really been that long? It still feels just as fresh as that night at Miabella, when we couldn’t stop locking eyes. Somewhere along the lines of your fast-paced walking and shy touches, I became totally smitten. There were plenty of ebbs and flows, but it always felt comforting—with you, it was always sweet in the end. Sweet like the hot chocolate on June 1st, 2024 (though that was too sweet, honestly).

As my partner, you’ve inspired me to be more confident in myself, to have more discipline, and to grow wiser into my best 25-year-old self. Just as you’ve inspired me, may you receive all the success and joy life has to offer. As I’ve been saying for a long time—you deserve the best.

Thank you for this one year of loving memories. Dating a gentleman like you made me the luckiest girl (also a girl who's now trying to communicate through coding—never would I have imagined this in my whole life).

Hope you’re doing good! Take good care of yourself.

I love you, Ushu![IMG_0002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af303211-8db2-4d4b-9e20-ec99a5bc9f96)
